Create the 2048 game with these files:

1. index.html
- Basic HTML structure
- Link app.js and index.css
- 4x4 grid container with tile containers for positioning
- Score display
- New game button

2. app.js
- Initialize 4x4 grid array
- Add two random tiles (2 or 4) at start
- Handle arrow key input (up/down/left/right)
- Implement tile merging logic:
  * Shift tiles in direction pressed
  * Merge adjacent matching tiles
  * Add merged values to score
- Add new random tile after each valid move
- Track tile positions and IDs for animations
- Update tile positions with transition data (from/to coordinates)
- Check win condition (2048 tile)
- Check lose condition (no valid moves)
- Update DOM with animation classes after each move

3. index.css
- Center grid on page
- Style 4x4 grid using CSS Grid with absolute positioned tiles
- Color tiles by value (2: #eee4da, 4: #ede0c8, 8: #f2b179, 16: #f59563, 32: #f67c5f, 64: #f65e3b, etc.)
- **Smooth tile animations (PRIORITY):**
  * CSS transitions for tile movement (transform: translate)
  * Scale animation for new tiles appearing (scale 0 to 1)
  * Bounce/pop effect for merged tiles (scale up then back)
  * Smooth color transitions between tile values
  * Use transform and opacity for performance (GPU acceleration)
  * Timing functions: ease-out for movement, ease-in-out for merges
  * Duration: 150-200ms for slides, 100ms for pops
- Style score and button with hover animations
- Responsive design

Game rules:
- Tiles slide as far as possible in chosen direction
- Matching tiles merge into sum
- Only one merge per tile per move
- New tile appears after each move
- Win at 2048, can continue playing

Focus on buttery-smooth 60fps animations using CSS transforms and transitions.
