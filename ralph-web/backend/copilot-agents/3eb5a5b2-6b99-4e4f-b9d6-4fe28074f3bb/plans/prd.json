      "Discovery: animation locking is currently a placeholder (animating flag) and inputs are not yet blocked during animated transitions — to be implemented under F003/F002 as appropriate.",
      "Focus remains on CSS transforms/transitions for performance; minor layout sizing uses clientWidth which may need refinement for strict responsive behavior.",
      "Started implementing F002: added touch swipe detection and basic input lock during moves (ANIM_DURATION=150ms); keyboard input already present."
